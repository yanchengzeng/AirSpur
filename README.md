How to play the game: Kill the enemies by shooting bullets and score required points.  

Keys/Mouse input: Use arrow keys to navigate and the space key to kill the enemies and move.(For level 2 "A","W","D","E" can also be used to fire bullets.)

Cheat Keys: For each level, press "P" to pass the game and "F" to fail the game. 

Known bugs: The scrolling screen was not implemented successfully and it was taken out from the final version of the game.

Extra features: Four extra shooting keys.

Impressions/Suggestions: I think this is a great start for me to get to know the basics of OOD and I realized that there are many things that I need to practice.
